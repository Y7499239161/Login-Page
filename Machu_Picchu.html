        <h1>Machu Picchu</h1>
        <p>Machu Picchu[a] is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a mountain ridge at 2,430 meters (7,970 ft).[9] Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas",[10] it is the most familiar icon of the Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province[11] above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and creating a canyon with a subtropical mountain climate</p>
        <b>History</b>

        <p><b><i>Machu Picchu was previously believed (by Richard L. Burger, professor of anthropology at Yale University) to have been built in the 1450s.[1] However, a 2021 study led by Burger used radiocarbon dating (specifically, AMS) to reveal that Machu Picchu may have been occupied from around 1420 to 1530 AD.[21][22] Construction appears to date from two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–1471) and Túpac Inca Yupanqui (1472–1493).[23][24]: xxxvi 
            A consensus among archaeologists is that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal estate for his use as a retreat, most likely after a successful military campaign. Although Machu Picchu is considered to be a "royal" estate, it would not have been passed down in the line of succession. Rather it was used for 80 years before being abandoned, seemingly because of the Spanish conquests in other parts of the Inca Empire.[1] It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors even arrived in the area</i></b></p>

    <h4>Growth of the World Heritage List and challenges to preservation</h4>
    <p>The World Heritage Convention entered into force on December 17, 1975, and in 1978 the World Heritage List was created. Twelve sites were inscribed to the list in its inaugural year, among them Aachen Cathedral (Germany), the Galapagos Islands (Ecuador), L’Anse aux Meadows (Canada), the rock churches of Lalībela (Ethiopia), the Wieliczka and Bochnia Royal Salt Mines (Poland), and Yellowstone National Park (United States). The list grew rapidly over subsequent decades, and in the 21st century it included over 1,000 properties in more than 165 countries.</p>
