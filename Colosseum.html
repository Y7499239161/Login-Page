    <h1>Colosseum</h1>

    <p><h1>History:</h1>
        Construction Period: Construction of the Colosseum began around 70-72 AD under the emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty and was completed in 80 AD by his son Titus. Modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (81-96 AD), the last of the Flavian emperors.
    
    </p>
    <p>Purpose: The Colosseum was built as a grand amphitheater for public spectacles, including gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, mock sea battles, executions, reenactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology. It served as a means to entertain the public and gain political favor for the emperors.</p>
